    "Question 1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
    "Answer 1.\n",
    "Function: A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions are standalone entities and are defined using the def keyword. They can be called directly by their name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method: A method is also a block of code that performs an action, but it is associated with an object or a class. Methods are functions that belong to a class and operate on instances of that class. They are defined within a class definition. You call a method on an object using dot notation (object.method()).\n",
    "Key Differences:\n",
    "    Belonging: Functions don't \"belong\" to anything specific (though they can be part of modules). Methods always belong to an object or a class.\n",
    "    Invocation: Functions are called directly: function_name(). Methods are called on an object: object.method_name().\n",
    "    self parameter: Methods typically take self as their first argument, which refers to the instance of the class the method is called on. Functions do not have this implicit self parameter.\n",
    "Question 2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
    "Answer 2.    Parameters: These are the names listed in the function definition. They act as placeholders for the values the function expects to receive when it's called.\n",
    "Arguments: These are the actual values that are passed to the function when it is called. The arguments are assigned to the corresponding parameters.\n",
    "Analogy: Think of a function definition as a recipe. The ingredients listed in the recipe are the parameters (e.g., \"flour\", \"sugar\"). When you actually bake the cake, the specific quantities of flour and sugar you use are the arguments (e.g., \"2 cups of flour\", \"1 cup of sugar\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Python\n",
    "def add_numbers(a, b):  # a and b are parameters\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "result = add_numbers(5, 3) # 5 and 3 are arguments\n",
    "print(result) # Output: 8\n",
    "Python supports different types of arguments:\n",
    "    Positional Arguments: Arguments passed in the order they are defined in the function signature.\n",
    "    Keyword Arguments: Arguments identified by their parameter name, allowing you to pass them in any order.\n",
    "    Default Arguments: Parameters that have a default value, making them optional.\n",
    "    Variable-length Arguments (*args and **kwargs): Allow a function to accept an arbitrary number of positional and keyword arguments, respectively.\n",
    "Question 3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
    "Answer 3.The most common way to define a function is using the def keyword:\n",
    "Python\n",
    "def my_function(param1, param2):\n",
    "    \"\"\"This is a docstring explaining the function's purpose.\"\"\"\n",
    "    # Function body\n",
    "    print(f\"Param1: {param1}, Param2: {param2}\")\n",
    "    return param1 + param2\n",
    "Calling a function:\n",
    "    Positional Arguments:\n",
    "    Python\n",
    "my_function(10, 20)\n",
    "Keyword Arguments:\n",
    "Python\n",
    "my_function(param2=20, param1=10) # Order doesn't matter with keyword arguments\n",
    "Mixed Arguments (positional first, then keyword):\n",
    "Python\n",
    "my_function(10, param2=20)\n",
    "With default arguments:\n",
    "Python\n",
    "def greet(name=\"Guest\"):\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "greet()        # Output: Hello, Guest!\n",
    "greet(\"Alice\") # Output: Hello, Alice!\n",
    "\n",
    "With *args (arbitrary positional arguments):\n",
    "Python\n",
    "def sum_all(*numbers):\n",
    "    total = 0\n",
    "    for num in numbers:\n",
    "        total += num\n",
    "    return total\n",
    "print(sum_all(1, 2, 3))       # Output: 6\n",
    "print(sum_all(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) # Output: 15\n",
    "With **kwargs (arbitrary keyword arguments):\n",
    "Python\n",

    "    # Output:\n",
    "    # name: Bob\n",
    "    # age: 30\n",
    "    # city: New York\n",
    "Question 4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
    "Answer 4.\n",
    "The return statement in a Python function serves two main purposes:\n",
    "    Exiting the function: When return is encountered, the function immediately stops its execution. Any code after the return statement within that function will not be executed.\n",
    "    Sending a value back to the caller: The return statement allows a function to send a result or a value back to the part of the code that called it. This returned value can then be used, stored in a variable, or passed to another function.\n",
    "<!-- end list -->\n",
    "    If a function doesn't have a return statement, it implicitly returns None.\n",
    "    You can return multiple values by separating them with commas. Python will return them as a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Python\n",
    "\n",
    "def calculate_area(length, width):\n",
    "    if length <= 0 or width <= 0:\n",
    "        return \"Invalid dimensions\" # Returns a string and exits\n",
    "    area = length * width\n",
    "    return area # Returns the calculated area\n",
    "\n",
    "result1 = calculate_area(5, 4)\n",
    "print(result1) # Output: 20\n",
    "\n",
    "result2 = calculate_area(-2, 5)\n",
    "print(result2) # Output: Invalid dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "def get_coordinates():\n",
    "    x = 10\n",
    "    y = 20\n",
    "    return x, y # Returns a tuple (10, 20)\n",
    "\n",
    "coords = get_coordinates()\n",
    "print(coords) # Output: (10, 20)\n",
    "Question 5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
    "Answer 5. \n",
    "Iterable: An object that can be \"iterated over,\" meaning you can go through its elements one by one. Examples include lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries, sets, etc. An object is iterable if it implements the __iter__() method (which returns an iterator) or the __getitem__() method.\n",
    "Iterator: An object that represents a stream of data. It provides a way to access elements of an iterable one at a time. An iterator must implement two methods:\n",
    "        __iter__(): Returns the iterator object itself.\n",
    "        __next__(): Returns the next item from the iteration. If there are no more items, it must raise a StopIteration exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship: An iterable gives you an iterator. You then use the iterator to actually traverse the elements.\n",
    "How they differ:\n",
    "    Purpose: An iterable is something you can loop over. An iterator is what actually does the looping.\n",
    "    State: An iterable typically doesn't maintain state of where it is in the iteration. An iterator does maintain its state (i.e., which element to return next).\n",
    "    Methods: Iterables have __iter__(). Iterators have both __iter__() and __next__().\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Python\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3] # This is an iterable\n",
    "my_iterator = iter(my_list) # Get an iterator from the iterable\n",
    "print(next(my_iterator)) # Output: 1 (calls __next__())\n",
    "print(next(my_iterator)) # Output: 2\n",
    "print(next(my_iterator)) # Output: 3\n",
    "# print(next(my_iterator)) # This would raise StopIteration\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use a for loop, Python internally does this:\n",
    "Python\n",
    "for item in my_list:\n",
    "    # 1. Calls iter(my_list) to get an iterator\n",
    "    # 2. Repeatedly calls next() on the iterator\n",
    "    # 3. Catches StopIteration to end the loop\n",
    "    print(item)\n",
    "Question 6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
    "Ansswer 6.\n",
    "Generators are a simple and powerful way to create iterators. They are functions that, instead of returning a single value and terminating, yield a sequence of values. Each time yield is encountered, the generator produces a value and pauses its execution, saving its local state. When next() is called on the generator again, it resumes execution from where it left off.\n",
    "How they are defined:\n",
    "Generators are defined just like regular functions, but they use the yield keyword instead of return.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Python\n",
    "def my_generator():\n",
    "    print(\"Starting generator...\")\n",
    "    yield 1\n",
    "    print(\"Resuming...\")\n",
    "    yield 2\n",
    "    print(\"Finishing...\")\n",
    "    yield 3\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a generator object (it doesn't execute the function yet)\n",
    "gen = my_generator()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"First next:\")\n",
    "print(next(gen)) # Output: Starting generator..., 1\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Second next:\")\n",
    "print(next(gen)) # Output: Resuming..., 2\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Third next:\")\n",
    "print(next(gen)) # Output: Finishing..., 3\n",
    "\n",
    "# print(next(gen)) # This would raise StopIteration\n",
    "Question 7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
    "Answer 7. The primary advantages of using generators are:\n",
    "    Memory Efficiency (Lazy Evaluation): Generators produce items one at a time, only when requested. This means they don't store the entire sequence in memory at once, which is crucial when dealing with very large or infinite sequences. Regular functions would typically build and return an entire list, consuming more memory.\n",
    "        Scenario: Processing a large log file line by line. A generator would read one line, process it, and then discard it, keeping only one line in memory at a time. A regular function might read the entire file into a list, potentially crashing if the file is too big.\n",
    "    Performance: Because they are lazy, generators can start processing data much faster than functions that need to compute everything upfront. This can lead to quicker startup times for applications.\n",
    "    Simplicity in Iterator Creation: Generators automatically handle the __iter__() and __next__() methods, and the StopIteration exception, making it much simpler to write iterators compared to manually implementing a class with these methods.\n",
    "    Infinite Sequences: Generators can be used to represent infinite sequences (e.g., an endless stream of Fibonacci numbers) since they only produce values as needed. Regular functions would struggle to produce an infinite sequence.\n",
    "    Pipelining: Generators are excellent for building data processing pipelines, where the output of one generator feeds into the input of another, creating efficient and readable code.\n",
    "Example (Memory Efficiency):\n",
    "Python\n",
    "# Regular function (might cause memory issues for large n)\n",
    "def create_list_of_squares(n):\n",
    "    squares = []\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        squares.append(i * i)\n",
    "    return squares\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generator (memory efficient)\n",
    "def generate_squares(n):\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",
    "        yield i * i\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using generator:\n",
    "for square in generate_squares(10**7): # Processes one square at a time pass\n",
    "Question 8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
    "Answer 8.\n",
    "A lambda function (also called an \"anonymous function\") is a small, single-expression function that you can define without a name. They are created using the lambda keyword.\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "Python\n",
    "lambda arguments: expression\n",
    "Key Characteristics:\n",
    "    Anonymous: They don't have a formal name defined with def.\n",
    "    Single Expression: The body of a lambda function must be a single expression, which is implicitly returned. You cannot have multiple statements or complex logic like if/else directly inside.\n",
    "    Can take multiple arguments: Just like regular functions.\n",
    "When are they typically used?\n",
    "Lambda functions are typically used for:\n",
    "    Short, throwaway functions: When you need a small function for a short period and don't want to formally define it with def.\n",
    "    As arguments to higher-order functions: This is their most common use case. Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments (e.g., map(), filter(), sorted(), min(), max(), key argument in sorting).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Python\n",
    "\n",
    "# Basic lambda\n",
    "add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
    "print(add(5, 3)) # Output: 8\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using lambda with sorted()\n",
    "students = [('Alice', 20), ('Bob', 25), ('Charlie', 18)]\n",
    "# Sort by age (second element of the tuple)\n",
    "sorted_students = sorted(students, key=lambda student: student[1])\n",
    "print(sorted_students)\n",
    "# Output: [('Charlie', 18), ('Alice', 20), ('Bob', 25)]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using lambda with filter()\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n",
    "even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))\n",
    "print(even_numbers) # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n",
    "Question 9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
    "Answer 9.\n",
    "The map() function applies a given function to each item of an iterable (like a list or tuple) and returns a map object (which is an iterator). The map object contains the results of applying the function to each item.\n",
    "Purpose: To transform each element of an iterable without explicitly writing a loop. It's a functional programming construct that promotes cleaner and often more concise code.\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "Python\n",
    "map(function, iterable, ...)\n",
    "    function: The function to which each item of the iterable will be passed.\n",
    "    iterable: One or more iterables whose elements will be passed to the function.\n",
    "Usage:\n",
    "    The map() function returns a map object. You usually convert this object to a list, tuple, or another suitable collection if you need to view all the results at once.\n",
    "    The function argument can be a regular named function or a lambda function.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "# Example 1: Squaring numbers in a list\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using a regular function\n",

    "added_lists = list(map(lambda x, y: x + y, list1, list2))\n",
    "print(added_lists) # Output: [5, 7, 9]\n",
    "Question 10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python\n",
    "Answer 10. \n",
    "These three functions are powerful tools in functional programming paradigms within Python, used for transforming and manipulating iterables.\n",
    "map()\n",
    "    Purpose: To transform each element of an iterable by applying a given function to it.\n",
